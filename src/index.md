## NC State Notebook Server

Welcome to the NC State University notebook server. 

**Acquisition of this server and development of the server infrastructure was supported National Science Foundation grant AGS 2112978.** 


## Purpose

This server provides electronic interactive notebooks. These notebooks contain interactive worksheets to be used in the classroom setting [(Petters, 2021)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/102/3/BAMS-D-20-0072.1.xml). The underlying technology leverages [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks. When a user "requests" a notebook, the server allocates dedicated computational resources for a limited amount of time (75 min). Each set of notebooks has a fixed number of available concurrent instances. For examples, the server provides 50 concurrent instances of the Atmospheric Physics Notebooks. This is sufficient to support their inclusion in coursework.

Each user receives their own working environment. After the allotted time of a checked out notebook (or sets of notebooks) is expired, the resource is destroyed and a new instance is created to restore the available pool. Changes made in the notebook are lost. However, newly created notebooks or changes to existing notebooks be downloaded if desired.   

## Use Policy

The material is provides free of charge and supplied without access barriers such as required registration or user login. If you plan to use these materials *regularly* for *sizable* in-class deployment, please consider contacting the author to avoid collision of class times and or request potential scaling of specific notebooks to match demand.
