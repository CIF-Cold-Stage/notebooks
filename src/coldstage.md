# Cold-Stage Control

The main purpose of this notebook is to interactively explore the control system of a thermoelectric cooled ice nucleation cold stage. The instructor guides the students through the basic theory of operation. Changing the inputs allows students to visualize the role of control parameters in setting the cold stage temperature .
