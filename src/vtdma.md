# Virtual TDMA

The main purpose of this notebook is to interactively explore the output of a volatility/hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (DMA) system. The instructor guides the students through the basic theory of operation. Changing the inputs allows students to visualize the role of multiply charged particles in shaping the tandem DMA response function.

    Provisioning of an instance requires a few seconds. The total number of concurrently available instances is 20. You may directly supply this link to students in your course for use during and after lectures. Note that students sometimes accidentally close browser tab. If they do so, they may use the link again to request a new set of notebooks. However, the original resource only reenters the pool after 75-95 min of the original request.
