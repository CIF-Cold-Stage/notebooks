The total mass-based hygroscopicity parameter from aerosol mass spectrometry derived composition is computed via the linear mixing rule. Monte-Carlo simulations and error propagation in quadrature is used to compute the range of the organic fraction that would satisfy hygroscopicity closure against an external constraint of a volume based hygroscopicity parameter within the stated measurement uncertainties.

","category":"page"},{"location":"about/","page":"Technical Details","title":"Technical Details","text":"The notebook framework here differs. It is mostly to serve interactive web applications. The focus is less on the code itself, but on leveraging high-level languages such as Julia or Python to create interactive content. For example, the notebook can be used as a web-front end to animate the output of computational models that run on the backend. Often these models are written in compiled languages with multiple dependencies. Serving such content to students (and the public) via web interfaces can be challenging. Local installs of the entire software can become complex due to platform dependence and dependency management. Containers are a convenient way to bundle and serve such web apps. It is possible to serve these containers through either JuyterHub or BinderHub. However, in practice there are several drawbacks.","category":"page"},{"location":"about/#Need-For-Different-Approaches","page":"Technical Details","title":"Need For Different Approaches","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"about/","page":"Technical Details","title":"Technical Details","text":"JupyterHub and BinderHub are designed to run on Kubernetes clusters in the cloud (e.g. zero-jupyterhub for Kuvberenetes). On premise installation is possible but not recommended. JupyterHub and Kubernetes clusters provide advanced resource management. Yet rapid scaling of the infrastructure at the beginning of a lecture is still slow, as new nodes will have to be provisioned and container image need to be pulled from a repository. The base-cost of the minimum number of manager and worker nodes is expensive. Hosting multiple different container images might require complex hub management. Startup times using this infrastructure can be several minutes before the application is ready. This includes bottlenecks of provisioning nodes, authentication on the Hub, loading of the notebook, and execution of the notebook. The latter is exacerbated when using Julia as the notebook language, which has additional compile lag. Overall this is a drain on classroom resources and annoying for users that are used to much faster load times.   ","category":"page"},{"location":"about/","page":"Technical Details","title":"Technical Details","text":"The desired behavior is to provide the user a URL which opens the app. The app should be immediately ready for use.

Containers are served via Docker swarm. Leveraging Pluto notebooks allows the notebook to be executed when the container is created. A set number of containers are pre-provisioned so that they are ready for immediate consumption. The user is served a link that opens the executed notebook. Each user obtains a unique link that is secured by a secret token, which prevents the accidental or intentional hijacking of a resource by a different user. Once open, the application is ready for immediate use. A monitoring script detects opened container instances and destroys them after a given timeout. A new container is created for the next user.","category":"page"},{"location":"about/","page":"Technical Details","title":"Technical Details","text":"In addition to the advantages to the user, this infrastructure is in many ways less complex than the JuyterHub framework. It can readily be deployed on premises using a wide range of hardware, and is scalable to large deployments. A regular workstation with 24 cores/64 GB of memory would be sufficient to serve 30+ students. The swarm can either be local or using cloud servers. Hosting multiple different applications residing in different containers with different architecture is possible. The code running the web server can be adapted to individual use cases.","category":"page"},{"location":"about/#Acknowledgments","page":"Technical Details","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"about/","page":"Technical Details","title":"Technical Details","text":"Development of this infrastructure was supported by NSF grant AGS 2112978.","category":"page"},{"location":"vtdma/#Virtual-TDMA","page":"Virtual Tandem DMA","title":"Virtual TDMA","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"vtdma/","page":"Virtual Tandem DMA","title":"Virtual Tandem DMA","text":"The main purpose of this notebook is to interactively explore the output of a volatility/hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (DMA) system.
